# CODE QUIZ
This week's assignment required me to create a quiz with Web API's with
functionality similar to the mock-up that was provided. HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used in this assignment. The following requirements are to be met based off the given scenario:

## User Story
```bash
   AS A coding boot camp student
   I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
   SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```


### Acceptance Criteria
```python
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

An example of what the functionality should be like is shown below:
